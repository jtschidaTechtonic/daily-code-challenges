# Daily Code Challenges
This is a simple repo for tracking my daily code challenges. The challenges are presented in the #code-challenge channel in the Techtonic slack.

## Folder Layout
The files are organized chronologically by month, and then by date/day of the week.  Each day will have a `.txt` file with the original description of the challenge, and a solution file with an extension corresponding to the language it was completed in (usually `.js` or `.py`).
